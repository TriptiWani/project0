# **Tic Tac Toe**
This is my Project Zero **TIC-TAC-TOE** as part of my Web Development Immersive 15 with General Assembly.

## Duration:
4 days

## Tech Stack:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- jQuery

## Features:

### Game Modes:
- 1 Player - Player(Human) v/s Computer
- 2 Players - Player 1 (Human) v/s Player 2 (Human)

### Pick Avtar:
The human players get an opportunity to choose avtar based on the mood from the below options:
- Drink Smiley
- Eat Smiley
- Tick
- Cross
- Lips
- Moustache
- Tom
- Jerry

If the player does not wish to choose an avtar, then by default *Green* and *Blue* themes will be selected.

### New/Continue:
The players have an option to 'Continue' the current game or start a 'New' game as per their wish.

### Score:
The scores of both the players are displayed on the 'Score Board'

## Nice to have:
Below listed are the features I would like to implement further to this game:
- *Easy* and *Hard* levels for AI
- Choosing which player wants to go first if the game is continued after one player wins
- Local storage
- Player v/s Player remotely
- Sounds
- Code refactoring: The code looks bulky. Could be improved
